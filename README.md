# Interstellar Neighbors

## Background

[Live link!](https://wremsen.github.io/InterstellarNeighbors/)

Interstellar Neighbors is a data visualization project focusing on the nearest planetary star systems to our solar system - our neighbors so-to-speak. The key focus of this project was to take a look at the nearest stars that have robust planetary systems, possible destinations in the cosmos for far future humans to visit.

By plugging into the NASA API, Interstellar Neighbors will be able to fetch data and characteristics of these far away stars to show us how they compare to our sun.

## Functionality & MVPs

With Interstellar Neighbors you will be able to:

- Scroll down the page and follow a to-scale line representing the distance away from our Sun
- Use the nav buttons at the top of the page to quickly "jump" to a specific star system
- Hover over key data points to recieve additional information

## Technologies

List the technologies, frameworks, and tools I used in this project. Include version numbers if applicable.

- D3
- Nasa API

## Implementation Timeline

- Thursday: Setup project, get webpack running and spend time with NASA API, begin initial work on classes
- Friday: Work on the logic of "scrolling down" the page and fetching the data to display for each star
- Monday: Wrap up logic and work on displaying of data and formatting
- Tuesday: Hopefully have all the logic done and can spend entire day on styling, making it look as good as possible
- Wednesday AM: Any last minute fixes and changes that need to be made to be ready for afternoon presentation

## Bonus Features

There are several additional features that could be worth pursuing in the future. Possible addtions:

- Links to articles, videos, and additional info on each of the various systems that dive deeper into the corresponding data
- More advanced visualization of data (animated models of each of the systems for example)
